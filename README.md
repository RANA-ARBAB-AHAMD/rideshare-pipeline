Rideshare Data Engineering Pipeline
Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) with Airflow, Python & PostgreSQL

This project is a complete end-to-end data engineering pipeline inspired by Azure’s Medallion Architecture.
It uses Apache Airflow as the orchestrator, Python for all ETL transformations, CSV layers as a local Data Lake, and PostgreSQL as the final warehouse.

The pipeline simulates a rideshare system by generating fake data, cleaning it, aggregating it, and loading the results into a warehouse for analytics or dashboarding.

🔷 Pipeline Overview

This project follows the industry-standard Medallion Architecture, commonly used in Azure Data Lake and Databricks pipelines.

🟫 Bronze Layer — Raw Data

Generated by a Python-based fake API

Contains uncleaned raw rideshare records

Stored as: rides_raw.csv

⬜ Silver Layer — Cleaned Data

Duplicate removal

Missing value handling

Enrichment (total fare, fare per km)

Timestamp normalization

Stored as: rides_clean.csv

🟨 Gold Layer — Aggregated Data

Aggregated analytics by driver:

Total rides

Total earnings

Total distance

Average fare

Average tip

Stored as: rides_agg.csv

🗄️ Warehouse: PostgreSQL

Final Gold dataset is loaded into:

Table: rides_analytics

This can be connected to Power BI, Metabase, or any BI tool.
